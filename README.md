# Quick Connect

Quick Connect allows you to enhance communication and interaction with your application's customers through online support and content sharing:

- **Online Chat (Support):** The real-time chat feature with excellent performance is one of the main capabilities of Quick Connect. Users can send messages at any moment, allowing your support team to engage with them in real-time.

- **Stories:** One of the trending and modern features in applications is the ability to share stories, which significantly increases interaction with users.

- **Management Dashboard:** With Quick Connect's advanced dashboard, you can designate support agents and admins to manage online support, stories, and service settings through this dashboard.

- **Notifications:** Quick Connect includes a notification service that allows you to configure which channels to use, under what conditions, and to whom notifications should be sent. You can also notify users who have left messages while offline through the specified channel and provide them with responses.

- **File Handler:** The service manages shared files from users and other parts of the service, capable of working with various storage solutions.
