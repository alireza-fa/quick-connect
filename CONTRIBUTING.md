## üõ† Workflow for Contributing

1. **Find or Propose an Issue:**
    - Check the open [Issues](../../issues) for available tasks.
    - If proposing a new task, **create an issue** and wait for approval from a maintainer.
    - Issues must include:
        - Clear title and description.
        - Proper labeling (`feature`, `bug`, `enhancement`, etc.).
        - Approval label or comment from a maintainer.

2. **Branch Creation:**
    - Always branch from the `main` branch.
    - Branch naming convention:
      ```
      {type}/{short-description}
      ```
        - Example:
          `feat/add-user-authentication`
          `fix/fix-order-validation`
          `docs/update-api-docs`

3. **Pre-Commit Checks:**
    - Install and configure the provided **pre-commit hooks** and **linters**.
    - Contributions that fail formatting, linting, or validation checks **will be rejected**.

4. **Code Changes:**
    - Follow the project's architecture and directory structure precisely.
    - Write clean, maintainable, and well-tested code.
    - Update relevant documentation and tests if necessary.
