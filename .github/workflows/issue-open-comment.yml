          MESSAGE: |
            Thank you for opening this issue! ðŸŽ‰

            We truly appreciate your contributions and the time you've taken to share your ideas or report a problem. To help us keep things organized and ensure we're focusing on active discussions, hereâ€™s how we handle issues and pull requests:

              - If an issue hasnâ€™t had any activity in the past **year**, it will automatically be marked as **stale**. Donâ€™t worryâ€”this is just a gentle nudge to see if itâ€™s still relevant. Youâ€™ll have **30 days** to leave a comment or update it to prevent it from being closed.
              - If no further activity occurs within those **30 days**, the issue will be automatically closed.

            For pull requests:
              - PRs that havenâ€™t had activity in **30 days** will also be marked as **stale**. This is a reminder to provide updates or request a review if needed.
              - If thereâ€™s no activity within **2 weeks** after being marked stale, the PR will be closed.

            To keep certain issues or PRs from being marked as stale, we use the **`no stalebot`** labelâ€”feel free to apply it where appropriate!

            Thank you again for your efforts in making this project better. If you have any questions or concerns about this process, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out! ðŸ˜Š
