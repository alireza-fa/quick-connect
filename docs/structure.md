# Project Structure: Quick Connect

This document defines the **Quick Connect** project structure, which is designed for clarity, scalability, and maintainability. This structure is non-negotiable and provides a clear organization for all components of the system. Below is the directory structure and a description of its purpose.

---

## Directory Structure

```
├── adapter
├── app
├── cli
├── cmd
├── config
├── deploy
├── docs
├── event
├── example
├── go.mod
├── logger
├── logs
├── Makefile
├── outbox
├── pkg
├── protobuf
├── README.md
└── types
```

---

### **Directory Descriptions**

#### **1. `adapter`**
- **Purpose:** Contains external adapters such as Redis, RabbitMQ, and other third-party integrations. Each adapter is isolated within its own subdirectory (e.g., `adapter/redis`, `adapter/rabbitmq`).
- **Note:** Repository logic for services is not included here and is defined within individual services in the `app` directory.

---

#### **2. `app`**
- **Purpose:** Contains the code for each microservice. Each service is placed in its own directory named based on the service, such as `userapp`. The package name is written in camelCase.
- **Structure Example:**
  ```
app/
├── userapp
├── orderapp
└── paymentapp
  ```

---

#### **3. `cli`**
- **Purpose:** Contains CLI tools. Examples include cli client.

---

#### **4. `cmd`**
- **Purpose:** Contains the entry points (`main.go`) for each microservice. Each microservice has its own directory named after the service (e.g., `cmd/user`).
- **Structure Example:**
  ```
cmd/
├── user
│   └── main.go
├── order
│   └── main.go
└── payment
└── main.go
  ```

---

#### **5. `config`**
- **Purpose:** Contains configuration loading utilities and shared configuration files. This directory is responsible for general configuration logic that can be used by all services.

---

#### **6. `deploy`**
- **Purpose:** Contains deployment files for each microservice. Each service has its own subdirectory, and different environments (e.g., `development`, `production`, `stage`) are defined within each service directory.
- **Structure Example:**
  ```
deploy/
├── user
│   ├── development
│   ├── production
│   └── stage
├── order
└── payment
  ```

---

#### **7. `docs`**
- **Purpose:** Stores all project documentation, including API specifications (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger), setup guides, and developer documentation.

---

#### **8. `event`**
- **Purpose:** Defines event contracts and abstractions used in the system. This directory contains versioned event contracts to ensure backward compatibility.
- **Structure Example:**
  ```
event/
├── v1/
│   ├── user_created_event.go
│   └── order_placed_event.go
  ```

---

#### **9. `example`**
- **Purpose:** Contains example code or usage demonstrations for different parts of the project.

---

#### **10. `logger`**
- **Purpose:** Contains the logging utility used across the project. The logger is responsible for structured logging and is compatible with log aggregation tools like ELK or Loki.

---

#### **11. `logs`**
- **Purpose:** Stores log files for each service in a dedicated subdirectory (e.g., `logs/user`). 
- **Note:** In the future, logs will be stored in `/var/log/{app_name}/logs.json` following standard practices.

---

#### **12. `outbox`**
- **Purpose:** Implements the Outbox pattern for event-driven communication. This directory contains a shared implementation that can be used across all services.

---

#### **13. `pkg`**
- **Purpose:** Contains shared packages that are used across multiple services. Only reusable and service-agnostic code is placed in this directory.
- **Structure Example:**
  ```
pkg/
├── logger
├── middleware
└── utils
  ```

---

#### **14. `protobuf`**
- **Purpose:** Stores `.proto` files for gRPC or Protocol Buffers. These files are versioned to ensure compatibility across services.
- **Structure Example:**
  ```
protobuf/
├── v1/
│   ├── user.proto
│   └── order.proto
  ```

---

#### **15. `types`**
- **Purpose:** Defines shared types such as generic structs or type aliases (e.g., `type ID uint64`). Only types that are shared across multiple services are defined here.

---

#### **16. `Makefile`**
- **Purpose:** Automates common tasks such as building, testing, and deploying the project. The `Makefile` includes commands for:
  - `make build`: Build the project.
  - `make test`: Run tests.
  - `make deploy`: Deploy the application.

---

### **Key Notes**
- **Versioning:** Event contracts and protobuf files are always versioned to maintain backward compatibility.
- **Logging Location:** While logs are currently stored in the `logs` directory, they will eventually be moved to `/var/log/{app_name}/logs.json` for better log management and integration with external tools.
- **Service Isolation:** Each service in the `app` directory is self-contained and can be scaled independently.
- **Configuration:** Centralized configuration is defined in the `config` directory, with the ability to override it for specific services or environments.

This structure enforces consistency, scalability, and maintainability across all aspects of the project.
